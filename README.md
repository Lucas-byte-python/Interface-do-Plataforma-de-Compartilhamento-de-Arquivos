# Interface-do-Plataforma-de-Compartilhamento-de-Arquivos

## This project is a visual interface of a file sharing platform, built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal is to showcase the layout and user experience of a system where users could hypothetically upload, view, and organize files in a simple and intuitive way.

## Although it's not functional (i.e., it doesn't actually send or store files), the project focuses on:

### Modern and responsive design
### Navigation elements simulating a real platform
### Clean and organized layout
### Visual animations and interactions using JavaScript to bring the interface to life

## This is a great example of a static prototype â€” perfect for practicing front-end skills and presenting the visual concept of a system.
